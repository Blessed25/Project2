What is git? 
Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. By control system, this means
that Git is a content tracker. Git can be used to store content — in our case it is mostly used 
to store code. 
The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as developers keep adding more code. Also many developers can
work in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have been 
committed and keeps records of the various versions as they occur.
By distributed Version Control System, we mean Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local
repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central 
server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control 
System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

Git is a distributed version control system. It helps to provide software management platform. 
It enables versioning and collaboration. No servers needed.
It ensures ensures integrity.
It is robust. That is, many users can access it. 

what is the different between git and github? Git is a version control system while Github is cloud based hosting service. Github manage Git repositories and Git track source code history.

Question 2
What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

Question 3 - What is the meaning of DVCS?
A distributed version control system (DVCS) is a type of version control where the complete 
codebase — including its full version history — is mirrored on every developer's computer.

Question 4 - What is the abbreviation of SCM?
Source Code Management
32.When should you use fetch, clone and pull command?

Git fetch – command to use when you want to get changes in codes from the remote repo and update your local repo but will NOT merge with the local working copy.

Git pull – command to use when you want to get changes in codes from the remote repo and update your local repo AND WILL merge with the local working copy.

Git clone – command to use when you get the code from the repository into your local repo.

Question 5 -  Write down 5 SCM names?

-Github
-Gitlab
-BitBucket (stash) 
-SVN  = Sub version
-CVS  = Concurrent version system
-TFS  = Team Foundation Server 




Question 6  What is git Branch?

A branch is an independent line of operation. A git Branch is a command that lets you create, list, rename and delete branches. the command does not let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands. Also it is the command that is used to show the branches in the local repository.


Question 7  What is git tag?

A Tag represents a version of a particular branch, Tagging is generally used to capture a point or version in history that is used for a marked version release. when tags are created they do not have further history of commit because they are unmodifiable. A tag points to a specific commit and no more commit can be added to a tag, with a tag you are sure to get the same code each time 
 
question 8   What is the difference between Branch and Tag in Git?

-  A branch is an active (mutable) line of development, it changes when a new commit is push, while a tag is an immutable line of development

-  A branch is modifiable meaning new codes is added any time a new commit is pushed, while a tag is unmodifiable with a tag you will be sure to get the same code each time



2t ll you create a branch and when will you create a tag? 
In Landmark we create branches to start a new line of development, while tags are created to signal completion of development activities
Tags are used for product releases
10. What does “git add” command do? 
It moves one or more files from working to staging area
11. What is the command to revert the code from staging area to working area? 
git reset <filename>
12. What does git revert command achieve? 
git revert moves files from local repo to working area 
13. What is the difference between git fetch and git pull? 
1~command delete a branch in the local repo?
git branch -d <branch-name>
18. What command delete a branch in the remote repo? 
git push <remote-name> --delete  <branch-name>
19. What is the branching strategy you are following in Landmark Technologies? 
 In Landmark, we have minimum of 3 branches. We deploy from dev branch to dev environmnet, from stage to QA/UAT environmnet, and from master branch to the production environment. 
 
   1) development:
 
   2) stage:
 
   3) master :  
    on top of master if anything goes wrong we'll create a bugfixes or feature to add new features  
     
 
20.How many branches do you maintain in Landmark?
In landmark, we maintain a minimum of 3 branches 
Development branch
Stage branch
Master branch
And code in development branch will go to development environment 
9. How to change git commit message after push (given that no one pulled from remote)?
   # git commit --amend -m "New Message"
   # example : git commit --amend -m "This is an updated commit message"
   # Good practice, write Good Commit Messages before committing

Q30 t is git cherry-pick and what does it do ? 
In Landmark we use $git cherry-pick <commitID>  to choose a commit 21. What is git cherry-pick and what does it do ? 
In Landmark we use $git cherry-pick <commitID>  to choose a commit 21. What is git cherry-pick and what does it do ? 
In Landmark we use $git cherry-pick <commitID>  to choose a commit How to rename the branch name?
   # git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
   # git branch -m <newname> if you are already in the in the branch.

Q31 What is the command to get the code from remote git repo?
   # git clone <<Git URL>>
   # This command will get the code from repository into your local machine

Q32 How to check the particular branch from github?
   #git checkout <<Branch name>> 
   #This will switch the branch.
   
   
   

Q37 In Which language is Git developed?
   Git was designed and developed in C language by Linus Torvalds, the Linux software developer
   
Q38  What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?
      Git merge allows you to merge branches from Git. only the target branch is changed, the source branch history remains i.e it preserve history of a branch.
      Git rebase compresses all the changes into a single patch then integrate that patch into the target branch. Git rebase flatten history. The completed work is transfer from one branch to another and unwanted history are eliminated

Q39   What is the difference between git reset and git revert?
      Git Reset allows you to go back to a previous commit and it deleted or remove any other commit on its way back to our target commit. Git revert will help create a new commit with the previous commit that you are reverting to. it will not delete any other commit in-between the commit we want to change or alter

Q40   Explain the git workflow?
      Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. Examples of workflows are; Centralised, Feauture branching, Trunk based development, Forking

Q41. What is merge confilts? Hqave you resolved any merge conflits in your projects?
# Merge conflits is is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
# No we have not.

Q42. How do we see many files are committed in a particular commit id?
#git log

Q43.What is github-webhook? can you name some git hooks?
#Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server.

#pre-commit: check the commit message for spelling errors.
 pre-receive: enforce project coding standards.
 post-commit: email/sms team members of a new commit.
 post-receive: push the code to production.

Q44. What is .gitignore file?
# A . gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore.


45. Explain how controls are configured in git the remote repositories of your current project and why?
Controls are configured using the git config command and can be used to add users to access the git repository.
46.	Explain you git branching strategy?
Our git branching strategy consist of a minimum of three branches, development, staging, and master. The development branch is used by programmer to develop the code, the staging branch is used to deploy on the testing server for testing, and the master branch is used to deploy on the live server. Additional branches are used for bugfixes and adding features as needed.
47.	What is git bare and git nonbare repository, use cases?
The git bare repository is a git repository without a working tree versus a git nonbare repository that has a working tree. Git bare repositories are used as a central repository for reference versus a git nonbare repositories are used normally track and commit changes in code.
48.	What is the git command to create the achieve files?
The git arc hive -o [name].zip HEAD command creates an achieve of the repository files.
